## Background

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/README_files/figure-gfm/trend-1.png)

- Some evidence that policies to enable more walking and cycling have been effective
- Little evidence that walking and cycling has become safer
  - Where have active travels levels increased, while casualty rates have continued to fall?
  - What are the characteristics of these places and can we learn from these places?

## Longer term trends

```{r, fig.height=3}
readRDS("../p1_ggplot_1979_2019.Rds") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2010-01-01"))
```

- Numbers of people killed/injured while walking and cycling have 'flatlined' since around 2010
- But what about the rate of casualties per unit time/population/distance?

## Safety during the pandemic

> The DfT thus calculated that the overall casualty rate for cyclists, the number of deaths or injuries per mile travelled, fell by 34% in 2020 against the year before, the biggest drop for any road user type.

- But this change in safety levels was not uniform

#### Data on cycling levels

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/code/tests/bradford-and-beyond_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

All counter values (black lines) and average counter values in sample of local authorities: Bradford, Derby, Leeds, Southampton

<!-- Todo: update this plot -->

## Key project outputs

- Datasets
  - New datasets with relative level change in active travel (just cycling) over time
  - New dataset
- Research findings
  - Substantial regional differences in trends for active travel levels (cycling), casualty numbers, and the rate of casualties per distance walked and cycled

- New methods
