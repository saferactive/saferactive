## Background

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/README_files/figure-gfm/trend-1.png)

- Some evidence that policies to enable more walking and cycling have been effective
- But have walking and cycling become safer?
  - Where have active travels levels increased and casualty rates fallen?
  - What are the characteristics of these places and can we learn from them?

## Longer term trends

```{r, fig.height=3}
# readRDS("../p1_ggplot_1979_2019.Rds") +
#   geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2010-01-01"))
```

- Numbers of people killed/injured while walking and cycling have mostly 'flatlined' since around 2010
- But what about the rate of casualties per unit time/population/distance?

## The pandemic

- Major changes to travel behaviour, with cycling increasing while other modes of travel are reduced
- Longer term impacts remain uncertain

## Safety during the pandemic

> The DfT thus calculated that the overall casualty rate for cyclists, the number of deaths or injuries per mile travelled, fell by 34% in 2020 against the year before, the biggest drop for any road user type.

- But this change in safety levels was not uniform

#### Data on cycling levels

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferactive/saferactive/master/code/tests/bradford-and-beyond_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

All counter values (black lines) and average counter values in sample of local authorities: Bradford, Derby, Leeds, Southampton 

<!-- Reproducible code:  -->
<!-- See https://github.com/saferactive/saferactive/blob/master/code/tests/bradford-and-beyond.md -->

<!-- Todo: update this plot -->

#### Road safety and inequality

This relates to the levelling up agenda

- Modelling - more needed in this area - relies on strong explanatory variables

## Key project outputs

- Datasets
  - New geo datasets with change in active travel (currently cycling) over time
  - New geographic datasets on adjusted collision rates over time
- Research findings
  - Substantial regional differences in trends for active travel levels, casualty numbers, and the rate of casualties per distance walked and cycled

- New methods
  - Framework for exploratory analysis of complex datasets for informing policy
  - Route network processing
  
- Software development
  - Development of the trafficalmr package
