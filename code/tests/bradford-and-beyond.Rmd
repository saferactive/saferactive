The starting point of this analysis is [Bradford data analysis](https://github.com/saferactive/saferactive/blob/master/code/tests/bradford.md) which compares the DfT's sporadic but widely spread-out manual count data with data from three automatic cycle counters in Bradford, with aggregate results shown in the figure below.

The aim of this document is to build on that by including more local authorities in the analysis.

```{r}
las_of_interest = c("Bradford", "Leeds", "Derby", "Southampton")
```

The map below shows the geographic distribution of countpoints associated with the local authorities of interest:


```{r}
las_of_interest
u = "https://github.com/saferactive/saferactive/releases/download/0.1.4/d_counter_summaries.Rds"
f = basename(u)
if(!file.exists(f)) download.file(u, f)
counters_year = readRDS(f)
counters_sf = counters_year %>% 
  group_by(Easting, Northing) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), LA = first(name)) %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("Easting", "Northing"), crs = 27700)
counters_of_interest = counters_sf %>% filter(LA %in% las_of_interest)
qtm(counters_sf, bbox = sf::st_bbox(counters_of_interest), basemaps = leaflet::providers$OpenStreetMap.Mapnik) +
  tm_shape(counters_of_interest) +
  tm_dots(size = "n", col = "n", alpha = 0.3) 
```

The temporal trend of the manual counts is as follows:

```{r}
# u = "https://github.com/saferactive/saferactive/releases/download/0.1.4/d_counter_summaries.Rds"
# f = basename(u)
# d_joined = vroom::vroom("~/saferactive/saferactive/dft_traffic_counts_raw_counts_2021-06-15.csv.gz")
# saveRDS(d_joined, "~/saferactive/saferactive/dft_traffic_counts_raw_counts_2021-06-15.Rds")
# d_joined = readRDS("~/saferactive/saferactive/dft_traffic_counts_raw_counts_2021-06-15.Rds")
# 
# d_sample = d_joined %>% filter(name %in% las_of_interest)
# class(d_sample)
# d_sample_df = as.data.frame(d_sample)
# write_rds(d_sample, "~/saferactive/saferactive/d_sample.Rds")
d_sample = readRDS("~/saferactive/saferactive/d_sample.Rds")

d_summary_la = d_sample %>%
  select(PedalCycles:BusesCoaches | matches("Year|name")) %>% 
  group_by(Year, name) %>%
  summarise_all(sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = PedalCycles:BusesCoaches, names_to = "mode")

```


```{r}
ggplot(d_summary_la) +
  geom_line(aes(Year, value, colour = mode)) +
  facet_wrap(~name) +
  scale_y_log10()
```


```{r}
manu_counts = d_sample %>% 
  group_by(count_date = lubridate::ymd(count_date)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_flow = mean(PedalCycles, na.rm = TRUE), name = first(name))

ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(count_date, mean_flow), data = manu_counts) +
  geom_smooth(aes(count_date, mean_flow), data = manu_counts) +
  facet_wrap(~name) +
  ylim(c(0, 10))


# auto_counts %>% 
#   group_by(date) %>% 
#   summarise(mean_flow = mean(hourly_mean_flow, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
#   ggplot() +
#   geom_line(aes(date, mean_flow)) +
#   geom_smooth(aes(date, mean_flow)) +
#   geom_point(aes(count_date, mean_flow), data = manu_counts, colour = "red") +
#   geom_smooth(aes(count_date, mean_flow), data = manu_counts, colour = "red") 
```

Plots showing all counter point trends in the case study local authorities, and average counter values per year are shown in the graph below.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# table(counters_of_interest$n)
# summary(counters_year$Year)
counters_of_interest_year = d_sample %>% 
  group_by(CP) %>% 
  mutate(n_years = n(), Cycles = PedalCycles) 
counters_of_interest_agg = counters_of_interest_year %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(Cycles = mean(Cycles, na.rm = TRUE), name = last(name))
# table(counters_of_interest_year$n_years)
counters_of_interest_lines = counters_of_interest_year %>% filter(n_years > 1)
counters_of_interest_points = counters_of_interest_year %>% filter(n_years == 1)
table(counters_of_interest_lines$n_years)
table(counters_of_interest_year$name)
table(counters_of_interest_agg$name)
summary(counters_of_interest_year$Year)

length(unique(counters_of_interest_year$CP))
counters_of_interest_year %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(Year, Cycles, group = CP), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(Year, Cycles, group = CP), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(Year, Cycles), data = counters_of_interest_agg, colour = "orange", size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2018:2020)) +
  ylim(c(0, 10))
# u = "https://github.com/saferactive/saferactive/releases/download/0.1.4/dft_traffic_count_d_joined_of_interest.Rds"
# d_joined_of_interest = readRDS(url(u))
```

Plotting this per LA suggests cycling uptake during the pandemic has been variable.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# table(counters_of_interest$n)
# summary(counters_year$Year)
summary(counters_of_interest_agg %>% filter(name == "Derby"))
counters_of_interest_year %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(Year, Cycles, group = CP), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(Year, Cycles, group = CP), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(Year, Cycles), data = counters_of_interest_agg, colour = "orange", size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2018:2020)) +
  ylim(c(0, 30)) +
  facet_wrap(~name)
# u = "https://github.com/saferactive/saferactive/releases/download/0.1.4/dft_traffic_count_d_joined_of_interest.Rds"
# d_joined_of_interest = readRDS(url(u))
```


## Automatic count data

```{r}
f_south = list.files("~/hd/data/project-data/cyclecounters/Cycling_DataShare_Robin/Southampton/", pattern = "csv", full.names = TRUE)
d_south = purrr::map_dfr(f_south, read_csv)
head(d_south$Sdate[1:5])
lubridate::dmy(d_south$Sdate[1:5])
d_south
d_south_clean = d_south %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::dmy_hm(Sdate), month = lubridate::round_date(date, unit = "month"))
d_south_monthly = d_south_clean %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(percent = mean(cyclepercent, na.rm = TRUE), cycle_count = sum(cycle002 + cycle003, na.rm = T))
d_south_monthly %>% 
  # ggplot(aes(month, percent)) +
  ggplot(aes(month, cycle_count)) +
  geom_point()
```
