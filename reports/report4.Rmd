# Introduction

The Saferactive project is funded by the Department for Transport. 
It aims to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in road safety for active travel. 

We have used a range of nationally available datasets to estimate and visualise road safety, including stats19 collision data, DfT and TfL traffic counts, NTS survey returns and 2011 Census commute data.  

# Input data

TfL counter data (Central, Inner and Outer London count points only)

Mean count per Borough, over the period 2015 - 2020. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/132374206-40a7b092-d3f0-42cc-877e-a8552b6d8921.png")
```


Change since 2015 in each Borough.

```

DfT counter data

Mean count per LAD, over the period 2010 - 2020. 

# ```{r}
# knitr::include_graphics("")
# ```

# National trends in cycle volume

The number of cyclists saw a small increase over the ten years prior to 2019, according to three different data sources. 

In 2020, the mean number of cyclists passing DfT traffic count points was three times higher than in previous years. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/130480677-af7ea79d-94f8-4812-8ec6-9321a5b6b4e0.png")
```

Estimated change since 2011 in cycle flows at a national level, based on a GAM generated using the DfT and TfL counter data

```

# National trends in collisions and collision risk

Change in cycle KSI 2010 - 2019

# ```{r}
# knitr::include_graphics("")
# ```

In the period 2010-2019, risk of cycle KSI has reduced. 
This reduction has mainly occurred since 2014, and can be seen when casualty data are assessed using all three measures of cycle volume.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/130476560-7aabd05c-b540-4deb-b0a4-4d994c3c7a2f.png")

# Regional trends in cycle volume

Total distance cycled per year in each English region (based on NTS survey)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/133634243-6449b3c1-61dd-429c-bc41-562841968ff4.png")
```

Mean AADF cycle flow per DfT counter in each region (including Scotland and Wales). This is based on the raw flows per counter.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/132316899-1bbc1cc9-687e-4df3-9c7a-3074778dd107.png")
```

Mean change in AADF cycle flow per DfT counter in each region (including Scotland and Wales). This is based on the change in flow at each counter, calculated as the raw flow minus the minimum flow for the given counter.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/133624726-227a7114-0fb1-4f62-bd06-a139f7245b60.png")
```

Mean AADF cycle flow per TfL counter

# ```{r}
# knitr::include_graphics("")
# ```

Estimated mean change in cycle flows, according to GAM model based on the DfT and TfL cycle counters
