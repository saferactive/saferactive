# Introduction

The Saferactive project is funded by the Department for Transport. 
It aims to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in road safety for active travel. 

We have used a range of nationally available datasets to estimate and visualise road safety, including stats19 collision data, DfT and TfL traffic counts, NTS survey returns and 2011 Census commute data.  


# National trends

The number of cyclists saw a small increase over the ten years prior to 2019, according to three different data sources. 

In 2020, the mean number of cyclists passing DfT traffic count points was three times higher than in previous years.

```

In the period 2010-2019, risk of cycle KSI has reduced. 
This reduction has mainly occurred since 2014, and can be seen when casualty data are assessed using all three measures of cycle volume.

# Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and rat-runs

# Data visualisation

# Web application

Turing Geovisualization Engine (TGVE or eAtlas) is a web application to visualize spatio-temporal data. The application can be deployed on GitHub pages {{cite}} which is a free service from GitHub for public/open source projects. The TGVE is capable of processing large amounts of data with focus on network optimisation (data transfer) and making use of modern client (computers/smart devices) GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to generate web (browser) based visualizations.

State:
* What data is used in the TGVE
* How it can be used to draw insights/analyse the data
