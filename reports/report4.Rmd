# Introduction

The Saferactive project is funded by the Department for Transport. 
It aims to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in road safety for active travel. 

We have used a range of nationally available datasets to estimate and visualise road safety, including stats19 collision data, DfT and TfL traffic counts, NTS survey returns and 2011 Census commute data.  

# Input data

TfL counter data (Central, Inner and Outer London count points only)

Mean count per Borough, over the period 2015 - 2020.

```


Change since 2015 in each Borough.

# National trends

The number of cyclists saw a small increase over the ten years prior to 2019, according to three different data sources. 

In 2020, the mean number of cyclists passing DfT traffic count points was three times higher than in previous years. 

```{r}

```

In the period 2010-2019, risk of cycle KSI has reduced. 
This reduction has mainly occurred since 2014, and can be seen when casualty data are assessed using all three measures of cycle volume.
