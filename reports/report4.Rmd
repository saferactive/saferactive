# Introduction

The Saferactive project is funded by the Department for Transport. 
It aims to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in road safety for active travel. 

We have used a range of nationally available datasets to estimate and visualise road safety, including stats19 collision data, DfT and TfL traffic counts, NTS survey returns and 2011 Census commute data.
