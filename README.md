# 1 Background

<!-- *Please refer to relevant research and literature (where available) and any gaps in knowledge and explain how the proposal develops or adds to learning. Please also describe the extent of current provision or implementation of the measures the proposal seeks to develop and current evidence (if any) for their effectiveness.* -->

Active transport can tackle some of the most pressing issues of the
21<sup>st</sup> century, including air pollution, the obesity epidemic,
and transport-related social exclusion (Lucas 2004; Johansson et al.
2017; Saunders et al. 2013). Recognising these wide ranging benefits,
the government has ambitious targets for active transport, as outlined
in the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (CWIS): to double the
number of stages cycled compared with the baseline year of 2013, and
“reverse the decline in walking” (Department for Transport 2017).
Notably, the government aims to double cycling *whilst simultaneously
reducing the number of people killed or seriously injured per billion km
cycled year-on-year*.

Data on cycling rates and future investment plans suggest that the
cycling uptake target will be difficult to achieve (Road Safety GB
2019). Much research funded in support of the CWIS, such as the
Propensity to Cycle Tool (Lovelace et al. 2017), has focussed on
boosting walking and cycling levels, with relatively little attention
paid to safety, despite the fact that cycling and walking casualties
have not fallen since the CWIS baseline year of 2013 (see Figure 1).
Safety is a major barrier to greater uptake of cycling and walking
(Horton 2016; Jacobsen, Racioppi, and Rutter 2009), with fear of
collisions and “too much traffic” being the top two reasons cited in DfT
research (Nathan 2019). <!-- ^[ -->

<!-- ## Road safety interventions -->

The research outlined in the previous paragraph suggests that road
safety measures can be an effective way of meeting both the active
travel uptake *and* the road safety targets in the CWIS. This raises the
question: which road safety measures work best to protect pedestrians
and cyclists? Recent research has found that a range of traffic calming
measures can reduce casualty rates, including ‘20 mph limits’
(implemented only via signalling) and ‘20 mph zones’ (which can include
optional measures including speed cameras) (Maher 2018; ROSPA 2019),
‘filtered permeability’ interventions including and rising and fixed
bollards, and a range of speed humps. A range of additional traffic
calming measures is described in the DfT’s Local Transport Note (LTN)
01/07 (Department for Transport 2007). The focus of this study will be
on three types of intervention, because these have received attention
from the perspective of active travel (Mulvaney et al. 2015), and
because data on their spatial (and in some cases date of implementation)
is relatively abundant:

-   20 mph zones, which are well documented in a recent study by
    Maher (2018), and local case studies published for Bristol (Bornioli
    et al. 2018) and Greater London (Sarkar, Webster, and Kumari 2018).
    <!-- Geographic data has been made available on the distribrution of Glasgow's extensive 20 mph zones.^[ -->
    <!-- See http://www.gosafeglasgow.com/news/20-mph-zones. -->
    <!-- ] --> Data on the spatial extent, attributes and time of
    implementation of 20 mph zones will be collated from a range of
    sources, including via .gov.uk websites, newspaper articles and
    OpenStreetMap, building on research estimating the accuracy of
    crowd-sourced road data (Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball 2017).
    <!-- ^[ -->
    <!-- The road charity Brake has informally offered to support the project with data provision. -->
    <!-- ] -->
    <!-- - 20 mph limits, which are often single roads with 20 mph signs. OpenStreetMap, which is increasingly complete for roads [@barrington-leigh_worlds_2017], will be used to identify these, with appropriate care taken to assess the reliability of the data. -->

-   Physical traffic calming measures, including the location of speed
    cameras and speed hump data from local authorities OpenStreetMap.

-   Filtered permeability, which will be measured on a sliding scale
    reporting connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists, relative to
    motorised modes.

Reproducible code that accesses, cleans and stores intervention data
will be published in an R package, with the working title of
**trafficcalmr**. This will lead to a *step change* in knowledge on how
to access and process historic road calming intervention data, filling
an important gap in current knowledge, and providing a robust evidence
base on which future interventions can be prioritised and monitored.

<!-- There has been various efforts from different perspectives into crash data and STATS19 dataset itself. We are not aware of a comprehensive national scale data science and analytics driven effort that could be used by stakholders. -->
<!-- In terms of identifying hotspots of crash data, there is an affort by [@colacino2017] in Italy. However, the results were released in Linked Open Data (LOD) for linked data developers. The use of Linked Open Data and relevant family of technologies including RDF (Resource Description Framework), LinkedGeoData, SPARQL and GeoSPARQL are all familar to us and we have used them in previous work. -->
<!-- There are various types of work based on vulnerable roard users. One of the pieces of work focused on cyclists is identifying hotspots for cyclistst in London [@collins2019use].  -->
<!-- In terms of spatial analysis of crashes, there is a considerable body of work. However, according to [@loo2015spatial] whose focus on the methods of spatial analysis of road collisions: "There has been little work on the subject of HRL definitions".  -->
<!-- ## Exposure data -->

Exposure estimates of pedestrians and cyclists to road danger has long
been seen as a difficult component of road safety research. A report
funded by the AA Foundation for Road Safety Research stated that “hard
facts are lacking about the amount and pattern of activity which takes
place each day in the road environment by pedestrians according to their
age, gender and social background” (Ward et al. 1994). This is still
largely true today, but data availability and processing capabilities
have improved greatly, allowing estimates of walking and cycling levels
for specific trip purposes to be estimated down to the route segment
level. We will build on our previous research estimating exposure at
area levels for road safety research (Lovelace, Roberts, and Kellar
2016) and extend it down to the road segment level using methods
developed for the Propensity to Cycle Tool, but using higher resolution
data, walking routing algorithms to estimate overall active transport
levels, to create ‘heatmap’ estimates of exposure.

# 2 Knowledge of the relevant regulations and guidance

<!-- *Please refer to the relevant regulations for the traffic calming measures or provision that the proposal relates to and any available published guidance. If guidance is lacking or patchy then please explain how the proposal will address this issue. Provide details of any necessary consents or permissions needed to carry out the project.* -->

SaferActive will be a digital technology project using open data, with
no direct impact on physical infrastructure, so to some extent road
traffic calming regulations do not apply. We have good knowledge of
guidance and the relevant regulations regarding road and street design
and will use this to inform the scenarios of change represented in the
application. Furthermore, users of the SaferActive web application
should be aware of the relevant guidance. We will direct users towards
guidance on integrated planning for urban transport contained in the
*Design Manual for Urban Roads* (Lahart et al. 2013) and the recent book
by John Parkin on designing for cycle traffic (Parkin 2018) to ensure
interventions are done as part of joined-up transport plans. On specific
road traffic measures, we will direct people towards the Local Transport
Note 01/07 (Department for Transport 2007), the Design Manual for Roads
and Bridges (DMRB) and guidance on 20 mph zones in the House of Commons
Briefing paper CBP00468.

# 3 Ethical and Privacy Issues

<!-- *Please describe any potential issues regarding the privacy of participants and information provided by or concerning them, as well as of any other information sources used. Any risks and mitigation management plans for these should be fully discussed. Please ensure you have a policy in line with the current GDPR.* -->

The project fully complies with ethical standards at the University of
Leeds. The project will exclusively use open data, meaning that GDPR
will not apply. There will be no personal data and the STATS19 data is
already anonymised.

We are aware of the sensitive nature of some road safety datasets. The
main datasets used by the project will be geographic aggregates. If for
unforseen reasons we needed to work with sensitive data on the project,
we would solicit advice from the Data Owner, the Data Protection Officer
in University of Leeds’ Faculty of Environment and the funder before
proceeding.

# 4 Project Structure and Timetable

<!-- *Please provide a project timetable (perhaps in a table or Gantt chart) including milestones for the completion of different stages (where appropriate). A table should also be provided for any potential risks to the completion of the project together with proposed mitigations.* -->

The structure of the project over its 18 month duration is shown in
Figure 2. There are 3 main stages: (1) data access, cleaning and
processing; (2) analysis and modelling; and (3) deployment of results.
Key milestones will be the completion of the data processing stage
(month 9),
<!-- development of testable scenarios of traffic calming interventions, with estimated impacts on safety, based on the machine learning (ML) work () ; -->
release of a publicly available web application (month 12), and the
workshops scheduled for months 10 and 17.

As a digital technology project delivered by an experienced team, the
risks involved in funding this proposal are relatively small. Three main
risks, and mitigating actions, are outlined in the table below.

<!-- If it still proves difficult to find a suitable researcher we will look hire researchers in ITS and LIDA to work on the project. -->

| Risk              | Mitigating action                                                                 |
|:------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recruiting issues | Promotion to ensure role is well known in the data science research community.    |

# 5 Experience of the Project Team

<!-- *Please describe the relevant experience and expertise of key team members. One-page CVs, including any relevant publications as an appendix, will be useful for more complex applications (please ensure you have permission from them). Please explain key roles and the expected input and involvement of each team member. It will be helpful to see how quality control of the outputs will be handled, and who will be responsible for day to day project arrangements. Any internal and/or external oversight arrangements should be mentioned, especially for more complex projects. For some projects, the establishment of stakeholder groups to inform the project should also be identified.* -->

Dr Robin Lovelace is an Academic Fellow in Transport and Big Data at
ITS. He has expertise in data science, with a focus on transport and
geographic data, and is author of widely used books on the subject,
including *Efficient R Programming* and *Geocomputation with R*. He has
demonstrable experience delivering high impact work, notably as Lead
Developer of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), which is being used to
design strategic cycle networks in local authorities across England and
Wales
<!-- had an up-time of over 99% over the past 3 years and served more than 50,000 unique users -->
(Lovelace et al. 2017).

Dr Samantha Jamson is Professor of Transport Psychology specialising in
aspects of workload and distraction with a focus on how processing of
information from the road environment affects road safety. She has
expertise in the design and evaluation of innovative road safety
measures, ranging from low cost engineering interventions to in-vehicle
workload managers. She also has experience in the human factors of
interface design and the guidelines which should be used to ensure
information presentation is clear and appropriate to the task in hand.
This project will use her specialist road safety knowledge at the
interface between engineering and psychology.

Dr Roger Beecham is an expert in Geographic Data Science and
Visualization. With a PhD from the world-leading centre for Information
Visualisation [giCentre](https://www.gicentre.net), he has published
award-winning papers in geo-spatial data visualization at the
prestigious IEEE VIS conference. Roger’s current research focusses on
the application of modern data science for both data analysis and
communication. Roger will work closely with Layik and Robin in
contributing to the project’s methodology, proposing visualization
interface designs and exploring and evaluating new approaches for
uncertainty representation.

Dr Layik Hama is a technology expert passionate about road safety
worldwide. After completing his PhD in Computer Science he led the
development of two startup projects, one of which was replicating
(www.freebase.com) which was acquired by Google and is now Google
Knowledge Graph. Layik has been based at Leeds Institute for Data
Analytics (LIDA) since May 2018, working with Robin on open data and
research to support sustainable transport and Roger on a visualization
framework funded by the Turing Institute. He will be the technical lead,
using cutting edge technology to deploy the results in a scalable web
application.

A recent conference paper by three of the team members shows we have a
track record of collaboration on data science for road safety
research.[1] We have also collaborated on writing a peer-reviewed R
package called **stats19** for increasing public access to reproducible
road safety research (Lovelace et al. 2019).

# 6 Innovation

<!-- *Innovative ideas with much potential road safety benefit are particularly sought by the Trust. Plans to roll out or scale up innovative approaches which have been successfully trialled and tested are also encouraged. The programme is not designed to cover the delivery costs of existing schemes but could cover the costs of evaluating an existing programme.* -->

SaferActive will innovate in a number of areas, pushing the boundaries
of applied data driven road safety research, and advancing the
knowledge-base needed to effectively prioritise road safety schemes for
pedestrians and cyclists. A highly innovative aspect of the project will
be its use of four datasets (on exposure, casualties, roads, and
historic interventions) that have never previously been combined at the
national level. This will add a huge amount of value to existing open
datasets and provide a unique opportunity to learn from previously tried
interventions.

The machine learning methods will allow not only better insight into the
impacts of past interventions on vulnerable road users, but also
projections of how effective *future* interventions could be. After
testing the performance of training datasets against independent test
data, we will provide the results nationwide. This will lead to
innovation indirectly: by providing vital evidence on the likely impacts
of different schemes, local authorities and other stakeholders will be
able to taylor interventions to maximise both road safety *and* active
transport impacts of new schemes. The quantification of ‘filtered
permeability’ will be another innovative aspect of the project.

The most innovative aspect, however, will be the publication of the
outputs in an interactive web application, ensuring wide uptake and
maximum impact. We believe these innovations can lead to a step change
in the policy, practice and public debate of road safety for vulnerable
road users.

<!-- Innovative ideas with much potential road safety benefit are particularly sought by the Trust. Plans to roll out or scale up innovative approaches which have been successfully trialled and tested are also encouraged. The programme is not designed to cover the delivery costs of existing schemes but could cover the costs of evaluating an existing programme. -->
<!-- The main innovative approach of this project will be in the processing, analysis and visualization of the road safety data at a national scale. The work accomplished in development of the R package stats19 will be extended in a unique way by providing stakeholders and the wider public with a data-driven approach to road safety. We hope to democratise and effect a cohesive agenda for road safety research and for public understanding of risk. -->
<!-- A particularly innovative aspect of the project will be in developing an online tool for flexible exploration of the STATS19 data. Road safety campaigners and members of the public will be able to pursue their own lines of inquiry. We will develop dynamic, tightly coupled map and summary views that allow users to to explore data subsets and comparisons of their own through mouse touch interaction. Designing-in such flexibility has consequences and crucial to our approach here will be incorporating features that support correct and judicious use of data -- for example using new techniques from the Information Visualization domain to represent uncertainty information and presenting accompanying analysis vignettes demonstrating statistical issues associated with comparison reporting. We believe this approach -- developing flexible interfaces that also build statistical literacy -- to be both prescient and necessary. -->
<!-- Finally, the outputs of the project will be ready to be used in further research. It is envisaged that one of the ways the data would be used is training of machine learning models of predicting crashes or generating alerts to prevent them. -->
